Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development.<br>
The GPL comes with both rights and obligations.<br>
Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product,<br>
you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request.<br>
The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github,<br>
perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.<br>

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.)<br>
that are closed source or crippled by a patent,<br>
we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.<br>
